This repository contains my favourite snippets in Java, Python, JavaScript.It's a small personal library,but also open for collaborators!

* [Traffic.java](Traffic.java) : This file contains a Java program that creates a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for a traffic light simulation. It uses Java Swing to build a window with three radio buttons for "RED," "GREEN," and "ORANGE," and a text field that changes color and text based on the button selected.
* [RegValidation.js](RegValidation.js) : This file contains a simple Python script that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. It uses an iterative approach to calculate and print the sequence to the console.
* [fibonacci.py](fibonacci.py) : This file contains a JavaScript function named validate(). This function is designed to perform client-side form validation for a registration form, checking that the username, password, and date of birth fields are not empty and match specific patterns (like a valid email format for the username).
